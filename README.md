# LightController
Open source project to control light in the room, garage, street, house etc;

In this project I used small Atmel AVR microcontroller Attiny13A, Pir sensor HC-SR501;

and handmade optodriver (light sensor based on phototransistor and Rail-To-Rail OP mcp6021);

The program written on C language in Atmel Studio 7 IDE;

In PCB folder you can find schematic circuits and PCB;

In LightController folder you can find source code and Atmel Studio project;

In D3MG_PCB folder you can find PCB for DIN-rail package D3MG;

In Simulation folder you can find Proteus 8 project file for device simulation;

In FUSEBIT_scr folder are screen shots with fuse bits configuration from Khazama programmer;
In BOM folder you can find BOM(bill of materials) of main board and photodriver;
